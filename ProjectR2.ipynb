In many cases, automating analytical and decision-making processes is necessary because of the large volume of data and the speed with which new data are generated. In this course, we will examine how data analysis technologies can be used to improve managerial decision making. We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining through real-world examples and cases to place data mining techniques in context, to develop data-analytic thinking, and to illustrate that proper application of these techniques is as much an art as it is a science.
